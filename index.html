                    Smoking causes many health complications such as increased risk of cancer, heart disease, lung complications, and strokes. 
                    Approximately <span class="highlight"> 1 out of 10 Australians</span> smoke on a daily basis. 
                    To illustrate the impact smoking has on Australians, the bubble plot reflects that states with higher rates of daily smokers have a life expectancy lower than the national average of 83. 
                    These states include <span class="state">Tasmania</span>, <span class="state">Queensland</span>, and the <span class="state">Northern Territory</span>. 
                    This concludes that <span class="highlight">higher levels of smoking reduces life expectancy.</span>
